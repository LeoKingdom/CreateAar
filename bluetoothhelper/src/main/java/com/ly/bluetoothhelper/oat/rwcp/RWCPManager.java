/**
 * <p>This class implements the Reliable Write Command Protocol - RWCP. It manages RWCP segments and the
 * encapsulation of data into a RWCP segment.</p>
 * <p>For any byte array known as a potential RWCP segment, it is passed to this manager using
 * {@link #onReceiveRWCPSegment(byte[]) onReceiveRWCPSegment}. This method will then analyze the array in order to
 * get a {@link Segment Segment}. Then depending on the {@link com.ly.bluetoothhelper.oat.rwcp.RWCP.OpCode opration code}
 * and the current {@link com.ly.bluetoothhelper.oat.rwcp.RWCP.State state} it handles the received segment.</p>
 * <p>This manager provides a {@link #sendData(byte[]) sendData} method in order to send a byte array to a connected
 * device using RWCP. If a session is already running, this method queues up the messages.</p>
 * <p>The transfer should be cancelled using {@link #cancelTransfer() cancelTransfer} when the device is
 * disconnected.</p>
